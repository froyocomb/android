thou-shalt-take-the-L: Lollipop Restoration Project
=========================================================

This repository contains reconstructed `repo` manifests of pre-release Android 5.0 ("Lollipop") builds.

As of now, no builds have been reconstructed.

Preparing a Build Environment
-----------------

For installing dependencies, refer to the article ["Initializing a Build Environment"](https://web.archive.org/web/20140208084633/http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html) from the AOSP documentation.

It is recommended to use an older Linux distribution. All builds have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 ("Trusty Tahr"), which can be downloaded from [here](https://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04.6-desktop-amd64.iso).

For very early builds, gcc-4.7 and g++-4.7 are required.

Downloading Source
------------------

To get started with downloading the source code, experience with Git and [`repo`](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/reference/repo) is needed.

To initialize a repository tree using one of the manifests provided by this project, execute a command like this (see the table above for available `<build>`s):

    repo init -u https://github.com/froyocomb/android.git -b thou-shalt-take-the-L -m <build>.xml

Then to download the respective code, execute:

    repo sync

Compiling
---------

To initialize the build environment, execute the following command:

    source build/envsetup.sh

Then pick from one of the available build targets by executing the command:

    lunch

As appropriate device trees are not available in the source, the only targets that are possible to pick are the generic ones.

To compile Android, type:

    make CC=gcc-4.6 CXX=g++-4.6
    
Running
-------

You can run the compiled build with the Android Emulator.

In the Ubuntu build environment, you may run the currently compiled build with the in-tree emulator by executing the command:

    emulator
